        <h1>Hello Sochi!</h1>
        <p> The biggest resort town on what's called the "Russian Riviera," 
            Sochi is preparing to step onto the world stage as the host of the 2014 Winter Olympics. 
            Somewhat ironically, Sochi is really quite temperate for most of the year, 
            with its Black Sea waters warm and swimmable well into October. 
            The Arboretum and Riviera Park are among the cityâ€™s most popular destinations. 
            Serving as a beautiful backdrop for Sochi are the Caucasus Mountains, 
            home to the nearby snow skiing resort of Krasnaya Polyana. </p>

       <h1>What is good about Sochi?</h1>
       <p> Sochi City is well-known amongst nationals for being the "resort city", 
           a place you go to unwind and enjoy cool breezes and the waters of the Black Sea. 
           But to get a real sense of the history of the area and the culture of the country, 
           a visit to the Museum of History is in order.</p>

            Sochi is one of Russia's most southern cities, 
            located on the Black Sea coast almost 1,000 miles south of Moscow. 
            It's Russia's busiest seaside resort, attracting more than 4 million 
            visitors every year to its mountains and sweeping beaches.
             It is perhaps most famous for hosting the Winter Olympics in 2014.</p>
